    <h1>Tree</h1>
    <p>
      A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a
      collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a
      list of references to other nodes (the “children”). This data structure is
      a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used
      more effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Binary Tree</h2>
    <p>
      Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A
      binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of
      two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and
      a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or
      deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each Node can only have either zero, one or two Nodes</li>
      <li>Each Child can only have one parent.</li>

      <li>INSERT - O(log N)</li>
      <li>DELETE / REMOVE - O(log N)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>PROS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Better than 0(n)</li>
      <li>Ordered</li>
      <li>Flexible Size</li>

    <h4>CONS</h4>

      <li>No 0(1) operation</li>

    <h2>Binary Heap</h2>
    <p>
      Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure. Heap is one efficient
      implementation of an abstract data structure called a priority queue. In a
      heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the
      root, thus priority queue is often referred to as heaps irrespective of
      their implementation. Heap is the most useful data structure when it is
      necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest)
      priority. One of the most common implementations of the heap is the binary
      heap which is basically a binary tree. A binary heap is basically a binary
      tree with two additional properties. Shape property: It must be a complete
      binary tree, which means all the levels of the tree, except the deepest
      (last) one are fully filled. In case the last level of the tree is not
      complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right. Heap
      property: All nodes are either greater than or equal to or less than or
      equal to each of its children. If the parent nodes are greater than their
      child nodes, the heap is called a Max-Heap, and if the parent nodes are
      smaller than their child nodes, the heap is called Min-Heap
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>insert(num): Add a new key to the heap.</li>
      <li>delete(num): Removes a key from the heap.</li>
      <li>heapify: Create a (min or max) heap from the given array.</li>
      <li>
        findMax or (findMin): Return the max element from the heap or (min).
      </li>
      <li>
        extractMax or (extractMin): Remove and return the max element from the
        heap or (min).
      </li>
      <li>
        deleteMax or (deleteMin): Remove the max element from the heap or (min).
      </li>
      <li>size: Return the size of the heap.</li>
      <li>isEmpty: Is heap empty or not?.</li>
      <li>getList: Get the heap as an array.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>PROS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Better than 0(n)</li>
      <li>Priority</li>
      <li>Flexible Size</li>
      <li>Fast Insert</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>CONS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow Lookup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TRIE</h2>
    <p>
      A Trie, also known as a digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search
      tree — an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or
      associative array where the keys are usually strings. <br />Trie data
      structure was described by René de la Briandais in 1959 solely to solve
      the very problem of representing a set of words. The term “trie” comes
      from the word retrieval and is usually pronounced “try”, to separate it
      from other “tree” structures.<br />However, it is basically a tree data
      structure with certain rules to follow in terms of how it is created and
      used. It is a tree-like data structure wherein the nodes of the tree store
      the entire alphabet and strings/words can be retrieved by traversing down
      a branch path.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>insert(word): Adds a new word.</li>
      <li>remove(word): Removes the given word.</li>
      <li>contains(word): Checks if Trie has the given word.</li>
      <li>find(prefix): Returns all the words with given prefix.</li>
      <br />
      <li>LOOKUP/ FIND- O(log N)</li>
      <li>INSERT - O(log N)</li>
      <li>DELETE / REMOVE - O(log N)</li>
    </ul>
